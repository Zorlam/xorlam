        This website was only made to educate people about carding, and not to use it for illegal purpose.
        <p>WHAT IS CARDING?</p>
        Carding is an illegal activity where cybercriminals use stollen credit card information to make unauthorized purchases. The process of carding generally involves several steps:
        <ol>
            
            <li>Obtaining credit card information: criminals acquire stolen card details through various means, such as data breaches, phising attacks, purchasing from dark web markerplaces, or using malware to steal information directly from users or companies</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Testing card information: Once the card details are obtained, the criminal will test the validlity of the card. They may attempt small transactions on websites with poor security to see if the card works without getting flagged by the card provider of the merchant</li><p></p>
           <p></p>
           <li>Using the card for purchases: if the card details are valid, the cybercriminal will make larger purchases, often buying expensive items like electronics, or luxury goods, which they can resell for profit. They may also use the card to pay for services, cool right?</li>
         <p></p>
           <li>using proxies or VPN's: to hide their identities, carders often use proxies or VPN's to obscure thier location, making it harder for law enforcement agencies to track em down.</li>
        </ol>
